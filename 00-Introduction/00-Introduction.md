# Introduction
Welcome to *Linux for Creators*! This book has one goal: to enable gamers, creators, and everyday users to experience Pop!_OS as an intuitive, first-class GNU/Linux operating system. I want to show you how to unleash your potential with a powerful desktop environment for free software. The System76 developers have gone to great lengths to make a functional and flexible operating system for making, browsing, and simply enjoying your computer. This book augments that effort and acts as a guide for all the things you can do with Pop!_OS.

There is a lot to cover about Pop!_OS. I have strived to emphasize the essential tasks in sufficient detail for both beginners and advanced users. Almost everything has two approaches. Wherever possible, the steps required to accomplish a task are covered for both the graphical user interface (GUI) and the terminal. The chosen topics not only cover installation, navigating the desktop, managing software, and system administration, but also delve into troubleshooting and the online resources where you can further explore, discuss, share with the Pop!_OS community.

## What is Linux?
Linux, or more properly GNU/Linux, is a family of related operating systems made up of the GNU utilities and the Linux kernal.

## A Brief History of Pop!_OS
Prior to 2017, System76, an American computer manufacturer and creator of Pop!_OS, used Ubuntu as the operating system pre-installed on their hardware. When Ubuntu dropped the Unity desktop environment in favor of GNOME, System76 took advantage of the opportunity to create their own unique, in-house flavor of GNU/Linux based on Ubuntu. The first version of Pop!_OS was released to great fanfare in October 2017 and has continued to follow a twice-annual update cycle.

For the 21.04 release, System76 introduced the COSMIC desktop environment based on GNOME. The COSMIC desktop environment made Pop!_OS truly stand out as an independent operating system with its own design philosophy. Over time, a large community of users, gamers, and creative professionals developed around Pop!_OS.

Today, Pop!_OS is freely available for anyone to download and install on their computer.

## How to Read This Book
This book is meant to be both a reference manual and how-to-guide. Each chapter is dedicated to a specific topic and progresses in complexity as you read through it.

To a certain extent, I assume you have a bit of experience with GNU/Linux and want to improve your skills. This book will not cover tasks like using office software, music and movie players, organizing photos, browsing the web, etc. (but it will show you how to locate and install these kinds of software).
